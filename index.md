## FAQ

### how do i clear my username history?

run the following command to clear your username history

```
$un -clear
```

run the following command to clear your avatar history

```
$avh -clear
```

you can use `$toggletracking` to disable username/avatar tracking

### my server does not qualify for the pings command

there are requirements set for pings/mentioned to be tracked, as there is massive performance issues when nypsi tracks every
mention on every server, no matter how much they use nypsi.<br />

the requirements are as follows:

-   your server **must** have less than 150k members
-   your server owner must have an economy profile

the quick fix for this is to simply check the server owner's balance using the `$bal` command, if this doesn't work, try
paying the owner with `$pay @owner 1`

### whats with the lowercase?

i (max), personally love how lowercase text looks. which is why nypsi is almost entirely lowercase (no this will not change u
loser). it also gives a bit of a unique aesthetic to nypsi.

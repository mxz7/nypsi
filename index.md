## FAQ

### my server does not qualify for the pings command

this means that the server owner isn't an active nypsi user, to fix this, have the owner run some
commands, if this isn't possible, send the owner some nypsi money with `/pay`.

if you need further help, feel free to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/hJTDNST)

### whats with the lowercase?

i (max), personally love how lowercase text looks. which is why nypsi is almost entirely lowercase
(no this will not change u loser). it also gives a bit of a unique aesthetic to nypsi.

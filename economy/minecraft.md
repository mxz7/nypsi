# minecraft items

## pickaxes

pickaxes work the same way as fishing rods and guns do [`more info here`](https://docs.nypsi.xyz/eco/fishingandhunting)

## ores

you can receive ores from crates or from mining, more so from mining with the use of a pickaxe. you are not meant to sell
these ores, you can use the `/smelt` command aslong as you have everything needed (furnace and coal - you can buy from
`$shop`). keep in mind that 1 coal is needed for every ore you want to smelt, and furnaces are one time use per command.

## ingots and diamonds

ingots and diamonds are items that you are meant to sell, you can sell them with `/sell` or `/sellall`

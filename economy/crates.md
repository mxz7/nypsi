# crates

## how do i get a crate?

you can easily obtain vote crates by voting for nypsi with `$vote`.

## what do i get from crates?

you can get random items such as collectables and cars, but most notably being tools such as fishing rods, guns and pickaxes.

## how do i open my crates?

to open a single crate at a time, you can use `$open <crate>`, where you replace `<crate>` with the type of crate you want to
open.

for example:

```
$open crate
```

if you are a [premium member](https://docs.nypsi.xyz/premium) you are able to use the `$opencrates` command, which will
automatically open up to 20 crates at once for you.

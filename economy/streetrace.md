# street races

## how do they work?

street races work by starting an event in the current channel, then allowing members in that channel to join the street race.
to join they will need to have the available funds, and a car. if they don't have a car, they will be given a complimentary
bicycle 🙂

for every _tick_ in the street race, the next position of every user will be calculated using the following:

movement = (speed value of chosen car) + (random value between -4 and 8)

if movement is less than the current position, the position will not change

## how do i get a car?

you can get a car from opening crates, faster cars will be rarer than slower cars, however, you should keep more than one
car, as using a car in a race puts it on cooldown for a short while.

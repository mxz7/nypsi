### 🌵 features

better showcase of features can be found on the bot's website: [`nypsi.xyz`](https://nypsi.xyz)

##### 💸 gambling / economy

-   nypsi has a decent economy system mainly focused on gambling and working as a team to rob people who find themselves with a lot of money. i'd like to think that the `$blackjack` command is as realistic as you can get with a discord bot

##### 🛠 moderation

-   every `ban, kick, mute, warn, unban and unmute` that is ran through nypsi is logged and saved and can be accessed with the `$history` and `$case` commands. with all of these commands you are also able to punish multiple people in the same command. use `$help mod` to view all of the moderation commands available. you are also able to moderate the `$snipe / $esnipe` command by including a filter with `$sf`

##### ⛏ minecraft

-   `[disclaimer]` - this bot is not affiliated with minecraft/mojang in any way there are two minecraft related commands being `$mc` and `$skin`, both allow you to view information about a minecraft account, including past names and their current skin

##### 💬 social media

-   the `$socials` command allows you to view other people's social media accounts and allows you to add your own - your accounts will only be displayed if you add them to the bot, run `$socials help` for more information

##### 📊 server stats

-   nypsi tracks every server's member peaks, this information can be viewed with `$server`
-   nypsi is also able to create a member counter for your server, similar to other bots but allows you to customise it for free - `$counter`

##### 🎅 christmas countdown

-   24/7 running christmas countdown, updates daily
-   sends a message to a specified channel once everyday with a customisable message

##### 🎮 fun commands

-   there are a lot of fun commands available for use, including `$reddit` which allows you to grab a random image from any subreddit, as well as `$ddos` which will generate a _fake_ ip address
-   very simple method of creating small/large polls with the `$poll` command

##### ✅ information

-   nypsi is able to calculate join positions and join dates of any user in any server, this can be seen with `$join` or `$user`
-   there is also a `$lookup` command which allows you to lookup information about domain names and IP addresses

### 🏗 installation / cloning

i'm not gonna help with installation if you want to clone the code and make it for yourself, if you believe you're good enough to manage the bot you should be able to figure that out for yourself.

  "tips": [
    "**workers** are a great way to make money, they make money for you in the background. you can buy and manage them with **$workers**. you may get some worker upgrades you can use to upgrade you workers to earn more money for you",
    "a risky method of making money on nypsi is **gambling**, the most popular games are blackjack, mines and slots. you can also gamble your money and items with other players with **coinflips**",
    "**achievements** are an awesome way to track your progression through nypsi. some can be very easy to complete, with some taking a huge amount of dedication. you can view your currently in progress achievements with **$ach**",
    "making quick money on nypsi can be difficult, but for a quick boost, make sure to do **$daily** and to **$vote**. keeping up with these basic commands will help you progress",
    "did you know you can turn on vote reminders (/settings me notifications) to get a multiplier bonus?",
    "if you're already a professional and don't need these tips, you can turn them off with /settings me preferences",
    "**tasks** are similar to achievements, however they reset daily and weekly. they can be a quick and easy way to earn a crate",

    "to level up you need to have money in your bank and enough xp. you can view the requirements in **$profile**. once you get to level 100 you can prestige",
    "prestiging may sound scary, but it's not like other games you might be familiar with. when you prestige in nypsi you don't lose anything, your level just goes down by 100, and you gain a **personal upgrade**. these upgrades will persist through seasons and can be changed with a [**reroll token**](https://nypsi.xyz/item/reroll_token)",
    "need a bigger bank? use [**stolen credit cards**](https://nypsi.xyz/item/stolen_credit_card) to upgrade your bank capacity",

    "have a rare item? don't sell it with **$sell**!!!!!! put it on auction with **$auction** to sell it to another player for a lot more money",
    "did you know you *don't have to* @ someone to use commands with them? you can just use their username. even if you mistype it nypsi will try to find the correct person that you meant to target",
    "does someone have an item that you want? send them an offer for it! **$offer <user> <item> <amount> <price>**",
